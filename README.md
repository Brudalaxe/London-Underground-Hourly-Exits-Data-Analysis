The dataset included in this repo contains information on the numbers of people exiting stations on the London underground for each hour of the day.

This data is explored and analysed in the accompanying notebook, including a separate analysis for morning and evening peaks, the data is then visualised and a set of criteria is chosen to classify each station as 'work', 'residential' or 'other'.
